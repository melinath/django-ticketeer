Bug trackers. We know them. We need them. We hate them. Why? Mostly the user interface, and the difficulty of customization. And of course, once you choose a bug tracker, you can't change to use anything else.

With Ticketeer, you don't have to. Keep using the same bugtracker you always have, but get a nice, customizable django-based frontend smacked right on top of it!

Currently, Ticketeer only supports a subset of features for Trac. In the future, the plan is to support a range of features on Trac, Redmine, and Bugzilla installations.

Ticketeer was conceived and created in the heart of DjangoCon 2011. Many thanks to edunham for the suggestion!
